the idea of my homework is to be a kind of space game where the player can dodge meteorites hitting the spaceship and control the spaceship from the cockpit. the player can also perform small tasks, such as destroying too much space waste and finding more energy, recycling space waste and climbing the ladder, after the player has first pressed the button to open the door :9

I used ready-made prefabs that I found online. isn't it great how the gaming experience really feels like you are a robot on a spaceship. physical interaction can be found in several different forms, the game experience itself is really wonderful in its simplicity, and it's great how the appearance of the hands fits the environment - the game would seem to have a really great theme as a whole! wow! I tried to add the sound world, but I was running out of time.
